Resume belonging to Robert Testa
===

You can download the PDF [here.](https://github.com/rktesta/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf)

All files required to build from the LaTex file, resume.tex are here (helvetica.sty & res.cls).

I would also like to thank Michael DeCorte and Venkat Krishnamurthy for the document style.
